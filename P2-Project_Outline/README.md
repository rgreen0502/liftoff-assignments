## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

I am building an app that will help poker players to to be more aware of how they are faring as they play. It will track
the financial side of the game as well as wins and losses. It will also track the location, date, and type of game. There
will be a feature that keeps track of the time spent playing and the hourly rate of winnings and losses.

My son is a poker player and he was describing something that would be useful to him and his friends.

### Features
Include Features here

1. Bankroll Tracker: It will keep track of their bankroll. Money that is used to enter cash-games/tournaments will automatically
be withdrawn. Winnings/losses will be deducted/added automatically as well.

2. User Sign-up: Users will be able to login and see their own info.

3. Time Tracker: The amount of time for each game and an running total for the year will be tracked. Using these times and
the money won or lost the user will be able to track an hourly cost/gain for each session and overall.

4. Hand Tracker: I want to include a feature that will allow a user to input the details of a particular hand to be able
to look at it after the game is over.


### Technologies
Include Technologies here

Java
SpringBoot
Hibernate
Thymeleaf
MAMP
Bootstrap

I will have to learn how to integrate a timer into the app. I will also possibly have to learn how to integrate playing
cards into the process. I will need to learn more about bootstrap and probably a little bit of javascript.

### Tracker

I plan to use Pivotal Tracker.
